After extensive research, we have reason to believe that the sun may be habitable for fire-based life, including primitive single-flame microbes and more complex ember-like organisms capable of thriving under all manner of burning conditions, lead investigator Dr. Steven T. Aukerman wrote, noting that the suns helium-rich surface of highly charged particles provides the perfect food source for fire-based lifeforms. With a surface temperature of 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit and frequent eruptions of ionized gases flowing along strong magnetic fields, the sun is the first star weve seen with the right conditions to support fire organisms, and we believe there is evidence
